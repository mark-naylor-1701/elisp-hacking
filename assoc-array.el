;;; Commentary:
;;  For a very large associative array type value (alist, plist, or hash-table),
;;  Emacs will not display all the keys and values. This package supplies the
;;  functions to open a buffer dump the contents in a more readable form.

;;; Code:

(defun asca-list->alist (xs)
  "Convert an ordinary list into an alist.

Takes pairs from the original list XS and construcst cons cells
from them. If the list has an odd number of elements, the last
one will have a nil value."
  (let ((acc ()))
    (while xs
      (setq acc
            (append
             (list (cons (car xs) (cadr xs)))
             acc))
      (setq xs (cddr xs)))
    (reverse acc)))

(defun asca-hash-table->alist (ht)
  "Convert a hash table HT to an alist.

Uses key/value pairs to construct the cons cells."
  (cl-mapcar #'cons (hash-table-keys ht) (hash-table-values ht)))

(cl-defun asca-dump-alist (alist &optional (b (get-buffer-create "*dump*")))
  "Print out the key value pairs.

ALIST is the structure to be printed. Results go into a buffer. B is the
  optional buffer, defaults to *dump* if one is not supplied."
  (let ((alist (cl-copy-list alist)))
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window b)
    (erase-buffer)
    (save-excursion
     (while alist
       (princ (caar alist) b)
       (princ " :: " b)
       (princ (cdar alist) b)
       (princ "\n" b)
       (setq alist (cdr alist))))))

(defun asca-alistp (xs)
  "Determine if XS is a list of lists."
  (and (consp xs)
       (cl-every #'consp xs)))

(defun asca-dump-associative-array (aa)
  "Prints out the keys and their values of an associative array AA."
  (cond
   ((hash-table-p aa)
    (asca-dump-alist (asca-hash-table->alist aa) (get-buffer-create "*dump hash-table*")))

   ((asca-alistp aa)
    (asca-dump-alist aa (get-buffer-create "*dump alist*")))

   ((plistp aa)
    (asca-dump-alist (asca-list->alist aa) (get-buffer-create "*dump plist*")))))
