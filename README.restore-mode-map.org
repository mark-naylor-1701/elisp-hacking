* restore-mode-map
  Set the key bindings of a major or minor mode to the orginal bindings in the
  source file.

** Introduction
   Too many times, I have fat fingered key bound commands that have overwritten
   the key binding and the mode stops working correctly. Unwilling to have to
   restart the emacs session, I looked for help on the Libera #emacs channel. I
   got good advice on how to do this manually. This package is my attempt to
   automate the process.
