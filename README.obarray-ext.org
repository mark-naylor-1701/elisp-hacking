* obarray-ext
  Helper functions dealing with obarray interned symbols.

** Introduction
   Since I don't work with symbols on a regular basis, I tend to forget how they get interned, associated with values, etc. I usually remember that they are stored in an obarray, but not how to poke around the internals of those data structures.
