;;; file-ext.el --- Provide tighter control over find file functions. -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;  Basic find-file can be unpleasant to use. This module provides dynamic
;;  "wrapping" of find-file and find-file-read-only. It is sensitive to whenther
;;  helm exists and is enabled or if ido is enable.

;;; Code

(defun fxt-helm-find-files-read-only ()
  "See `helm-find-files'; but opens the file/buffer in read only mode."
  (interactive)
  (when (and (functionp 'helm-find-files)
             (call-interactively #'helm-find-files))
    (let ((name (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
      (if (file-exists-p name)
          (progn
            (read-only-mode 1)
            (current-buffer))
        (kill-buffer)
        (message "File %s does not exist." name)))))

(defun fxt-select-find-file ()
  "Determine which find file function to use."
  (cond
   ((functionp 'helm-find-files) #'helm-find-files)

   ((functionp 'ido-find-file) #'ido-find-file)

   (t #'find-file)))

(defun fxt-select-find-file-read-only ()
  "Determine which find file read only function to use."
  (cond
   ((functionp 'fxt-helm-find-files-read-only) #'fxt-helm-find-files-read-only)

   ((functionp 'ido-find-file-read-only) #'ido-find-file-read-only)

   ;; Default base-line function.
   (t #'find-file-read-only)))

(defun fxt-find-file ()
  "Replacement for basic `find-file'."
  (interactive)
  (call-interactively (fxt-select-find-file)))

(defun fxt-find-file-read-only ()
  "Replacement for basic `find-file-read-only'."
